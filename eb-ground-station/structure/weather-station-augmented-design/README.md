## Utilize existing mast

We want to determine what we need to do to rebuild the station structure in order to co-site both the OreSat ground station, and the weather station maintained by Prof. Elliott Gall.

There is a drawing in this repo that shows both the existing mast structure, and the augmented structure. We should have someone with structural expertise look over this drawing set. The intent is to extend the mast using a 15 foot section of 1-1/4 inch SCH 80 6061 aluminum pipe, and add a set of additional struts. The augmented parts are in red on page 3 of 3 of the set.

## Utilize existing utilities.

* There is a weather rated 120 volt 20 amp duplex GFI receptacle available, and one outlet is used for the weather station. The second outlet could be utilized for our service.

* There are two CAT-6 / RJ-45 receptacles available in a weather rated box, one of which is used by the weather station. The second one could be utilized for our needs. These CAT-6 circuits make their way through structured wiring to the penthouse communications rack, whereby they terminate at a patch panel next to a network switch.
