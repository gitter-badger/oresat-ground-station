## Requirements for Engineering Building Ground Station Structure
### G.N. LeBrasseur  15-Aug-2017


### Introduction

The Portland State University Aerospace Society and Oregon Small Satellite Project (OreSat) propose
to augment an existing weather station on the campus Engineering Building. The weather station is an
existing structure having been in place for several (maybe 4) years, and is in reasonably good physical
condition. It was suggested that this structure could be utilized to provide the physical support for the
proposed satellite ground station antenna on a co-site basis in order to fit within the economic constraints
on the OreSat project.

The design drawing *GS_Structure_1_1* illustrates the existing mast structure, and the proposed changes of
augmenting for the proposed co-site use. Page 3 of 3 of this document indicate the changes in red.


### Expected Loads

The appurtenances or components of the existing weather station have not been described in the drawing, primarily
because it is expected they pose minimal wind or structural load. It is expected that the predominant wind load would be presented
by the ground station antenna array which would be mounted at the top of the augmented structure on page 3 of 3.

The intent of the design is to sustainably survive a continuous wind load of 100 mph or less without damage or failure.

The physical wind load is expected to be within the following:


#### From manufacturer data sheet

 * 70 cm antenna [1] : 2.0 ft^2 at 100 mph
 * 2 meter antenna [2] : 2.5 ft^2 at 100 mph


#### Extended analysis

Upon conversation with the manufacturer it was discovered they did not have a specification of their product for
wind loads with ice. Being in the Pacific Northwest where ice is expected as normal, particularly when wind speeds
might be at their highest, a wind load with ice margin is applied as two (2) times the non-ice wind load value.

So for a wind load with ice safety margin, the following values should be used;

* 70 cm antenna: 2.0 ft^2 at 100 mph * 2 = 4.0 ft^2 at 100 mph
* 2 m antenna:  2.5 ft^2 at 100 mph * 2 = 5.0 ft^2 at 100 mph

**Total wind load: 4.0 + 5.0 = 9.0 ft^2 at 100 mph**


It is thereby anticipated that applying this wind load at the very top hight of the mast as described on page 3 of 3
would describe the extreme structural requirements of this system.
