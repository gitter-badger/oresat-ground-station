> You might want to make sure that the mast will work before bringing it in just so we don't have to mess around with it.
> Just make it so that it has a sturdy base so it wont tip over. We will also want to be able to have the antenna oriented
> normally and at 90 deg so that we can see the two beams (elevation and azimuth). Keep in mind that since we do not have
> a reference antenna for this frequency, the measurements will be not be in dBi which is usually the unit used for comparing
> antenna beam intensity to an isotropic field.

> I found the center of mass of the antenna and attached a pvc rod for guiding. The piece is not permanent but we have
> the pvc pipe cement to make it so when we are certain of its integrity.
> * The positioning arm on the antenna attached at the center of mass.
