   In the photo <preview-full-20170314_145322.jpg> the VNA range is from 420 MHz to 450 MHz, which is the entire Amateur 70 cm band. It appears the marker is mostly in the center of this range or 435 MHz, so I am going to take Marks comment as to mean the marker was indeed at 434 MHz.

> You might want to make sure that the mast will work before bringing it in just so we don't have to mess around with it.
> Just make it so that it has a sturdy base so it wont tip over. We will also want to be able to have the antenna oriented
> normally and at 90 deg so that we can see the two beams (elevation and azimuth). Keep in mind that since we do not have
> a reference antenna for this frequency, the measurements will be not be in dBi which is usually the unit used for comparing
> antenna beam intensity to an isotropic field.

> I found the center of mass of the antenna and attached a pvc rod for guiding. The piece is not permanent but we have
> the pvc pipe cement to make it so when we are certain of its integrity.
> * The positioning arm on the antenna attached at the center of mass.
